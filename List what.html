            <p>In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece 
                of information (such as an Internet bookmark, digital image, database 
                record, or computer file). This kind of metadata helps describe an item 
                and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching.[1] Tags are
                 generally chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by 
                 its viewer, depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from 
                 a controlled vocabulary.[2]

        <div class="content">
            <p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to 
                control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier o
                f an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default
                 functionality of an element type or provides functionality to 
                 certain element types unable to function correctly without them. 
                 In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.

            <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an 
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web page.
                [vague] HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as 
                text nodes. Each node can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes 
                can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML 
                nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the <title> 
                node represents the title of the document.
